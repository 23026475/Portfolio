                        <p>To replicate the GirlCode webpage, I started by designing the layout in Figma. I created a wireframe to outline the basic structure, including the header, navigation, and content sections. I then added details like buttons, text, and images to create a working prototype. I also exported the necessary assets, such as images and icons, to use in the development process.

                            <br>Next, I built the webpage's structure using HTML. I created the essential elements like the header, main content, and footer, ensuring everything was organized semantically. I placed the content within these elements, focusing on a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
                            
                            <br>Finally, I used CSS to style the webpage, replicating the layout from my Figma design. I applied the fonts, colors, and text styles, and used Flexbox and Grid to position elements correctly. I also ensured interactive elements like buttons and links had smooth transitions and consistent behavior. Through this process, I was able to bring the GirlCode webpage to life with a responsive and visually accurate design.</p>
